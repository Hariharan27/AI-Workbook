## 3. **Debt Reduction Strategy**

### 3.1 Immediate Actions (Week 1)

#### Security Debt Reduction
```java
// Priority 1: Fix SQL Injection
// Before
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";

// After
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, username);
```

#### Performance Debt Reduction
```java
// Priority 1: Fix Memory Leaks
// Before
private static final List<String> memoryLeakList = new ArrayList<>();

// After
private static final int MAX_SIZE = 1000;
private static final List<String> boundedList = new ArrayList<>();
```

### 3.2 Short-term Actions (Month 1)

#### Code Quality Debt Reduction
```java
// Priority 1: Extract Long Methods
// Before: 200+ line method
public String processUserRegistration(String username, String email, ...) {
    // 200+ lines of mixed responsibilities
}

// After: Multiple focused methods
public String processUserRegistration(UserRegistrationRequest request) {
    validateUserData(request);
    User user = createUser(request);
    sendWelcomeEmail(user);
    logRegistration(user);
    return "Success";
}
```

#### Architecture Debt Reduction
```java
// Priority 1: Implement Dependency Injection
// Before
public class LegacyUserService {
    private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db";
}

// After
public class UserService {
    private final DatabaseConnection dbConnection;
    private final EmailService emailService;
    
    public UserService(DatabaseConnection dbConnection, EmailService emailService) {
        this.dbConnection = dbConnection;
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Medium-term Actions (Month 2-3)

#### Testing Debt Reduction
```java
// Priority 1: Add Unit Tests
@Test
public void testUserRegistration_ValidData_ReturnsSuccess() {
    UserRegistrationRequest request = new UserRegistrationRequest("test", "test@example.com");
    String result = userService.processUserRegistration(request);
    assertEquals("Success", result);
}
```

#### Documentation Debt Reduction
```java
/**
 * Processes user registration with comprehensive validation and error handling.
 * 
 * @param request The user registration request containing all required data
 * @return Registration result with success/error message
 * @throws ValidationException if input validation fails
 * @throws DatabaseException if database operations fail
 */
public String processUserRegistration(UserRegistrationRequest request) {
    // Implementation
}
```
